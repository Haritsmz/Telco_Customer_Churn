# Telco Customer Churn Prediction
The "Telco Customer Churn Prediction" project focuses on developing a predictive model to identify customers who are likely to cancel 
their subscription with a telecommunications company. Customer churn is a significant concern for telecom companies, as retaining 
existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project aims to leverage historical customer data to 
predict churn rates and provide actionable insights to improve customer retention strategies.

# Objective
The main objectives of this project are: 
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understand the dataset's characteristics, distributions, and relationships between features.
2. **Data Manipulation**: Preprocess the dataset
3. **Machine Learning Models**:
   - Train machine learning models using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost algorithms.
   - Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Compare the performance of different models to identify the most effective one for customer churn prediction.
